SCP Escape Game - Detailed Explanation
Welcome to the SCP Escape Game! This document provides an in-depth explanation of the game's design, functionality, and code structure. It’s intended to help future developers and educators understand the logic and components behind the game.

Overview
SCP Escape Game is a text-based adventure where the player navigates a facility while avoiding a dangerous SCP entity. The game involves moving between locations, collecting items, and ultimately escaping before the SCP catches the player.

Key Components
Classes
Player Class

Attributes:
name: Player's name (string).
health: Player's health (integer, starting at 100).
backpack: List of items the player carries.
location: Current location of the player (tuple of coordinates).
Methods:
move(direction, max_x, max_y): Moves the player based on the direction provided (forward, backward, left, right). Ensures the player does not move out of bounds.
add_to_backpack(item): Adds an item to the player's backpack if there is room (up to 4 items).
Location Class

Attributes:
coordinates: Location coordinates (tuple of x and y).
description: Textual description of the location.
items: List of items available at this location.
Methods:
__str__(): Provides a string representation of the location including its coordinates and description.
Scp Class

Attributes:
name: Name of the SCP (string).
caution: Warning or caution details about the SCP (string).
power: Power level of the SCP (integer, affecting the player's health).
location: Current location of the SCP (tuple of coordinates).
Methods:
move(max_x, max_y): Randomly moves the SCP to a new location within the given bounds. Returns a message indicating the new location of the SCP.
Game Flow
Initialization:

The game starts by asking the player for their name and creates a Player object.
The game defines various locations within the facility, each with coordinates, descriptions, and possible items.
An SCP object is created and placed at a random location within the facility.
Gameplay Loop:

Display Initial State: Shows the player’s starting location and the initial position of the SCP.
Player Actions:
Movement: The player can move in one of four directions. The game checks if the movement is within bounds and updates the player’s location accordingly.
Item Collection: The player can pick up items from their current location. The inventory (backpack) is managed with a maximum capacity of 4 items.
SCP Movement: The SCP moves randomly after each player action. The game updates the SCP’s location and informs the player.
Winning and Losing Conditions:
Game Over: If the player and SCP occupy the same location, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
Victory: If the player reaches the Emergency Exit location, they win the game and receive a congratulatory message.
Code Details
Movement and Boundaries:

Movement is controlled by checking the player’s current location and ensuring they stay within the defined boundaries (max_x and max_y).
Item Management:

Items are managed with a simple list within the Player class. The player can pick up items if there is space in their backpack.
Random SCP Movement:

The SCP’s movement is determined using Python’s random.randint() function to select new coordinates within the facility’s bounds.
User Interaction:

The game uses the input() function to interact with the player, allowing them to choose actions and make decisions.
Future Enhancements
Expand the Map: Add more locations to increase the complexity of the game.
Advanced SCP Behavior: Introduce different types of SCPs with unique behaviors and effects on the player.
Graphical User Interface: Develop a GUI version of the game for a more immersive experience.
Conclusion
This text-based adventure game is designed to be a fun and engaging way to explore basic game development concepts in Python. It features simple mechanics, clear objectives, and room for future expansion. Whether you’re a developer looking to enhance your skills or a teacher evaluating a student project, we hope this game provides both entertainment and insight.

Happy gaming, and remember: The SCP is always lurking!
